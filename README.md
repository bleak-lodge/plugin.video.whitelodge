# Whitelodge add-on for Kodi

This add-on lists movies and TV-shows from various services (separated or mixed), available in the user's selected country.

It fetches the selected item's official stream id, and sends it for playback to the corresponding add-on,
which must be installed and configured (with linked active accounts where required) beforehand on user's system.

Supported services and their equivalent add-ons for playback are as follows:

- AMAZON PRIME     :  `plugin.video.amazon-test` - Sandmann79 repository
- BBC IPLAYER      :  `plugin.video.iplayerwww` - official Kodi repository
