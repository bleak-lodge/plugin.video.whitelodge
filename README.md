# plugin.video.whitelodge
Whitelodge add-on for Kodi

This add-on lists movies and TV-shows from various services (separated or mixed), available on the user's selected country.
It fetches the selected item's official stream, and sends it for playback to the corresponding add-on,
which must be installed and configured (with linked active accounts where required) beforehand on user's system.
